In Chapter 2 Ben was a vegan, but he has decided to opt for a new diet, the Carnivore diet, where he only consumes animal products. We will accordingly adjust Ben's diet where we supply him with chicken meat and eggs. Since our calculations are set up for sweet potato, kale, soybeans and blackberries we will feed the chickens a similar diet, but our fraction of soybeans will be increased since the majority of chicken feed consists of grains.\n",

Let's say this plot has an area of $X \\, m^2$. In this chapter, we perform a similar calculation as in Chapter 2, but we will include chickens. We will feed all the fruit and vegetable produce to the chickens while feeding the chickens and their eggs to Ben. In Chapter 4 there will be another plot for growing the chicken feed, this plot will have an area of $Y \\, m^2$. Will $Y$ be bigger than $X$? Think about it. You are going to work out the answer for yourself, with some help from this guide. But before you engage in the calculation make an estimate.

The outlet products from the \"chicken farm\" process should include **chicken meat, eggs, chicken waste and chicken manure.** The mass balances will be relatively straightforward, but let's have a closer look at the linear energy relationships. There will be two energy relationships, first the cabs, protein and fats fed to the chickens must add up to the total calorific requirements for the laying hens and broilers. The second energy relationship will center around Ben's 9000 kJ/day calorific requirement, where only meat and eggs make up the energy. The carb, protein and fat content of chicken meat and eggs will enable you to calculate the energy content of meat and eggs. Remember to work on a **dry basis** since water in the calculation only refers to the overall reaction water that forms or gets consumed.\n",
