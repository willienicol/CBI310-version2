    "Hopefully, it reminds you of the respiration videos in Chapter 1. We won't be getting into the metabolic details of the process of photosynthesis, but it is very interesting to note that photosynthesis is really the reverse reaction of aerobic respiration. But more about this later. Let's rather look at the picture above a bit more. Can you see the phospholipids that constitute the membrane? Do you know the chemical composition of this membrane? There is a lot of 'insertions' in the membrane. These are all specialized proteins that facilitate the process of capturing sunlight and turning it into ATP. We are not going deep into the mechanism of this process, we are rather interested in how these specialized proteins are made. The short answer to this question is that DNA contains the recipes to produce all the proteins that the organism requires, this is referred to as the central dogma of biology. Before we can understand the dogma we need some background on nucleic acids:\n",

The sun is the great energy source and photosynthesis is the great capturer that converts light energy into chemical energy. Do you understand that all fossil fuels are derived from ancient plant material? [Climate change](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climate_change) is a result of humans burning 'ancient sunlight'. It is highly unsustainable since the rate of $CO_2$ captured by 'current sunlight' is not nearly as fast as the release of $CO_2$ from 'ancient sunlight'.

The accumulation of oxygen into the atmosphere, caused by cyanobacteria is sometimes referred to as the [great oxygenation event](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Oxidation_Event). All eukaryotes developed because of oxygen availability. Once evolution discovered aerobic respiration the path was set for the development of [multicellular organisms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multicellular_organism), given that much bigger quantities of ATP could be generated with the availability of oxygen. Of course, cyanobacteria preceded the invention of aerobic respiration because oxygen had to accumulate in the atmosphere first. \n",
